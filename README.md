**Abstract:**   
In the present paper, a kinetic study is made of the behavior of a moiety-
conserved ternary cycle between the adenine nucleotides. The system contains
the enzymes S-acetyl coenzyme A synthetase, adenylate kinase and pyruvate
kinase, and converts ATP into AMP, then into ADP and finally back to ATP.
L-Lactate dehydrogenase is added to the system to enable continuous monitoring
of the progress of the reaction. The cycle cannot work when the only recycling
substrate in the reaction medium is AMP. A mathematical model is proposed
whose kinetic behavior has been analyzed both numerically by integration of
the nonlinear differential equations describing the kinetics of the reactions
involved, and analytically under steady-state conditions, with good agreement
with the experimental results being obtained. The data obtained showed that
there is a threshold value of the S-acetyl coenzyme A synthetase/adenylate
kinase ratio, above which the cycle stops because all the recycling substrate
has been accumulated as AMP, never reaching the steady state. In addition, the
concept of adenylate energy charge has been applied to the system, obtaining
the enabled values of the rate constants for a fixed adenylate energy charge
value and vice versa.
